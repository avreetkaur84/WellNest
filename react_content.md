3. Context Api - 

- Component naem is always in capital
- React is a single page application as we haev only one index.html file and everything happen in this only
- BrowserRouter uses history api that has record of all the url that we have visited so far and it keeps track of that
- Inside BrowseRouter, we make Route which is a component
- Link tag simply redirects us to desirable url instead of reloading the whole page like happens in anchor tag.
